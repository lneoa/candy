    <p> 
      <pre>
        Inhale all the air in the room
        Delete existence
        Black hole, flood the page
        So that the ink never dries
        Stay mad forever
        Protest earthquakes

        Suspension is sweet
        So haunt your loved ones
        And ascend like crude oil
        Rain amuse bouche

        Powerful men want and have everything
        I just want to have one thing
        All the air in the room
      </pre>
