    A small dead bird on the driveway of my childhood home <br>
    looking up at a really bright star <br>
    &emsp; the star wasn't a star <br>
    &emsp; it was a planet. <br>
    giving a black kitten milk from my house <br>
    &emsp; the scared neighbor calling across the streetâ€” <br>
    &emsp; <q>come back</q>  <br>
    steamed egg dessert, still warm. <br>
    hop-ping sidewa l k l ines with my knock-off razor scooter. <br>
    &emsp; the struggle of fold down the scooter, <sub>swearing, sweating</sub> <br>
    wild kumquats-smelling them up close <br>
    sitting on the kitchen counter <br>
    &emsp; eating big watermelon triangles cut by dad <br>
    drumming on watermelons in the market and pretending <br>
    &emsp; I knew which ones were good to choose. <br>
