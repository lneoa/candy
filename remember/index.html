    a small dead bird on the driveway of my childhood home. <br>
    looking up at a really bright star. realizing much later that the star was a planet. <br>
    wild kumquats and smelling them up close. <br>
    calvin and hobbes and goosebumps at the library. <br>
    giving a black kitten some milk from my house. <br>
    the neighbor across the street scared and calling for the kitten to return. <br>
    steamed egg dessert, still warm. <br>
    hopping over sidewalk ledges with my knock-off razor scooter. <br>
    how hard it was each time to fold down the scooter, ending with me in sweat. <br>
    sitting on the kitchen counter eating big watermelon triangles cut by dad. <br>
    swallowing white watermelon seeds and not the black ones. <br>
    softly drumming watermelons in the market and pretending I knew which ones were good to choose. <br>
