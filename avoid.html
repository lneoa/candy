    I (want to) avoid the emotional; thoughts around doubt and insecurity; negativity, cynicism, and hopelessness; black and white thinking; aloofness and spiritualism; judgement making; doing what someone wants; gender constructs; looking at my spending; intimacy; being overly protective; being controlling over others; walking out during conflict; total disconnect from emotions and wants; spending time with people who don't interest me; over-apologizing; worrying about the future; reliving the past.
