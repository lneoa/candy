    <b>3 in the afternoon, the couch, los angeles, ca</b> <br>
    a sleeping dog <br>
    a sister in pajamas <br>
    yesterday's coffee mug, empty and stained <br>
    a low pile rug <br>
    a ray of light <br>
    beige curtains <br>
    a tv in front of a cold fireplace <br>
    sounds from pokemon show
    twenty minutes have passed <br>
    it is 3:20 pm in the afternoon <br>
    cup of coffee from today now empty <br>
    feeling restless <br>
    sleeping dog changes position, facing me <br>
    I yawn <br>
    a fan in the corner with its cord wrapped and knotted around its body <br>
    a plate of sliced korean pears, yellowing at the edges <br>
    the sister wants to kill her <br>
