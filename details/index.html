      asian pear slices on a plate <br>
    </mark>

      crisp white slices <br>
      of a pear on a porcelain plate <br>
      yours to eat, <br>
      cut by your grandma, <br>
      washed and peeled by her hands, <br>
      brought home from that market she used to work at, <br>
      her son your uncle loaded the crates, <br>
      after having driven dirt roads and paved highways, <br>
      from your cousin who picked it from a tree. <br><br>
      Spring in China 1868 <br>
      a woman gives her son one 梨  <br>
      for the last time.

      ray of light <br>
    </mark>

    a single light <br>
    slices the curtain— <br>
    splays out on the floor. <br>
    weightless, it makes a mark <br>
    from a star photons carried in light speed spread  <br>
    over a sunlit earth turning and spinning like a yarn spindle spinning a blanket of warmth and life <br>
    eyes closed bathed in light energy melting in a pool of ultraviolet radiance <br><br>

      short little rug hairs, don't know what you are made of but you feel good to me and you provide warmth to our living space. low pile rug, where life happens. napping on the couch, gathering with friends, rough and tumble with the dog, a reliable space to fold the laundry. thank you for catching food crumbs and I hope you can forgive us for the first few months of puppy potty training. your pattern is lovely and not too distracting. I wonder who designed it and what their living space looked like. What music was playing when the idea was conceived, what the previous iterations, your spirital ancestors, were like. when you reach the end of your time in our home, where will you go? O, low pile rug.
