    <h1>&infin;te &sdot;s</h1>

    <pre>
      &infin;te &sdot;s
      silent and scattered &hellip;ses
      &sdot; &and; &dagger; &hearts;.
      the s&crarr;s, they &exist;, &sim;ply,
      like &bull;ets,
      &sim;p&le;. to the point.

      Try to &minus;.
      You ca &ndash; to &euro;pe;
      you can play with &spades;,
      with &clubs; &and; &diams;onds;
      play the &part;s;
      drink &empty; &cup;s.

      &or;

      You can look for &real; &pi;eces.
      What remains when you
      pick a&part; the l&int;:
      a graduation &cap;,
      a &copy; of his &deg;ree,
      loose &yen; from that time in Japan.
      Did he like his &cong;ee to be thick or &thinsp;?
      &le;ft or right-handed?

      No words spoken.
      No &image;s revisited.
      The s&cent;s are removed
      and done away.
      &forall; you know,
      None of the &reg;rets seem to &exist;.

      &darr;ingly fragi&le;,
      &there4; not long,
      Yet to reach &prime; a&ge;,
      Remembered once in the &sum;mer.
